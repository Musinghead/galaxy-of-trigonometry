# Assign5: Ray Tracing

## Group 1

> How do people come up with such ingenious arguments? It's the same way people come up with Madame Bovary or Mona Lisa. I have no idea how it happens. I only know that when it happens to me, I feel very fortunate.

## Project Title

"Galaxy of Trigonometry"

## For poster

Galaxy is a mix of chaos and harmony: unpredictable things happen at each moment while a few graceful math rules are revealed. By combining trigonometry and straight-line motions in a well-designed way, this project offers a glimpse of the beauty of Galaxy.

## Project Introduction

This project combines trigonometry and straight-line motions together to produce agreeable structures and uses ray-tracing technique to animate them. It shows how an object performs motions both in straight-line and circle at the same time. It depicts the shape of new moon with a few spheres. Moreover, a galaxy floor lights up the whole scene.
